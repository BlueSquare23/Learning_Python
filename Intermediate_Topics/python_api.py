For a better look at all of the available functions in the python
echosystem known as the "Python API" head on over to the python docs
https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/index.html
there you'll see a list of all the libraries available.

Some pretty cool ones to check out are,
    * shutils - for copying or moving files
    * Just any of the file and directory access stuff
    * http.server - for starting a simple python based webserver
    * The whole Generic Operating System Services section
    * The UNIX services modules
    * html - for html support
